# SSI COICOP Classification Experiments

This repository contains the code for running the experiments for the Machine Learning part.

The script for preprocessing the raw supermarket data was `0_preprocess.py`.
Aside from performing the preprocessing described in the report, 
it also splits the data into the time and store validation splits.

With the script `2_coicop_experiment`, we ran the ML experiments.
